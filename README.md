# RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule

RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule is the easiest way to transform a RRULE string representation (~~[RFC 2445](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt)~~ [RFC5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)) into an [EKRecurrenceRule](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/EventKit/Reference/EKRecurrenceRuleClassRef/Reference/Reference.html). **'EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE'** is an Objective-C category which adds a new initializer to the EKRecurrenceRule class. EKRecurrenceRule is available in iOS 4.0 and later and needs the EventKit framework.

In addition, "nextDate" API function is added to EKRecurrenceRule that returns the next date based on the specified recurrence rules.

## Getting Started

- Download RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule and play with the included Xcode project.
- For EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE:
	- Copy **'EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE.h'** and **'EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE.m'** into your own Xcode project.
	- Add `#import "EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE.h"` to all files you would like to use RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule.
- for EKReccurenceRule+NextDate:
	- Copy **'EKRecurrenceRule+NextDate.h'** and **'EKRecurrenceRule+NextDate.m'** into your own Xcode project.
	- Add `#import "EKRecurrenceRule+NextDate.h"` to all files you would like to use EKRecurrenceRule nextDate.

## Example

``` objective-c
#import "EKRecurrenceRule+RRULE.h"

- (void)testMethod
{
    // Test
    NSString *rfc2445String = @"FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-2"; // The 2nd to last weekday of the month

    // Result
    EKRecurrenceRule *recurrenceRule = [[EKRecurrenceRule alloc] initWithString:rfc2445String];
    NSLog(@"%@", recurrenceRule);

    // NextDate
    NSDate *today = [NSDate date];
    NSDate *nextDate = [recurrenceRule nextDate:today];
}
```

### Notes

- EKRecurrenceRule does add WKST=SU automatically
- EKRecurrenceRule does only support DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY frequencies
- EKRecurrenceRule:nextDate:
	- supports:
		- Frequencies: DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY
		- Rules: BYMONTH, BYDAY
	- does NOT support the following features from RFC5545 Recurrence Rule:
		- Frequencies: SECONDLY, MINUTELY, HOURLY
		- Rules parts: BYSECOND, BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYWEEKNO, BYSETPOS
		- Changing WKST is not supported; default is Sunday

### ARC

RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule uses ARC.

If you are including the RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule sources directly into a project that does not yet use [Automatic Reference Counting](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html), you will need to set the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag on all of the RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule source files. To do this in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. Now select all RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule source files, press Enter, insert `-fobjc-arc` and then "Done" to enable ARC for RRULE-to-EKRecurrenceRule.
